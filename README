                            BubbleEx
                            -------
 This example shows the usage of histogram and tuple manipulations using 
 ROOT system. All analysis manipulations (histo booking, filling, saving 
 histos in a file, etc...) are located in one class : HistoManager.
 
 The example has a simple setup of the Bubble Chmaber.

 1- Detector description:
 -----------------------
 
 BubbleChamber (BCshell, Bubble, liquid inside bubble, flanges, ports, plugs, bubble base), beamline, radiator, collimator, and photon dump. 

	
 	    
 2- An event: PrimaryGeneratorAction
 ------------------------------------
 
 The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
 radiator perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
 and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
 be changed via the G4 build-in commands of ParticleGun class.
 	

 3- Histograms:
 ------------- 
 To produce histograms, ROOT system must be installed
    
 BubbleEx can produce 12 histograms and 3 Ntuples.
   
 These histos are booked in HistoManager and filled from EventAction.
 
 One can control the name of the histograms file :
 default name     : BubbleEx
 format : root
 
 See HistoManager constructor
    
 Please install ROOT before enable histograming.
